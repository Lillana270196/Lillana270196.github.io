I’m Alina Vozna, a Ph.D. researcher passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Healthcare Innovation. My academic journey is a fusion of AI, cognitive science, and healthcare technology, aiming to create intelligent systems that enhance patient care and medical efficiency.

Currently, I’m part of the Ph.D. program in AI for Society at the University of Pisa & University of L'Aquila, focusing on empathetic AI and intelligent robotics for healthcare applications. My research lies at the intersection of Theory of Mind (ToM), Affective Computing, and Wearable Technology, striving to develop AI-driven solutions that understand and respond to human emotions in meaningful ways.---
