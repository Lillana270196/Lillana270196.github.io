Here, I share my journey as a Ph.D. researcher in Artificial Intelligence, exploring the intersections of robotics, cognitive science, and healthcare innovation.
This space is dedicated to documenting my work, ideas, and aspirations as I contribute to building intelligent systems that support and improve patient care.

Curiosity, inclusivity, and collaboration are at the heart of what I do — values that guide both my research and my everyday life.
